# Hogwarts House Tour

    This CLI project takes place at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! It's purpose is to allow first years 
    to learn more about the four Hogwarts houses. Traditionally, they would have their sorting ceremony take place before the Start-of-Term feast in the Great Hall. However, this time they are permitted to explore the house's history before The Sorting Hat has the final say.
